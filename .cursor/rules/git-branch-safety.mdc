# Git Branch Safety Rules

## NEVER touch master or staging
- NEVER commit to, push to, or merge into `master` or `staging`
- NEVER create PRs targeting `master` or `staging`
- NEVER run `git checkout master` to make changes

## Branch workflow
- All work happens on `dev` or `feature/*` branches
- Feature branches are created FROM `dev`
- All PRs target `dev`
- Only the developer manually promotes: dev → staging → master

## PR creation
- Always use `--base dev` when creating PRs with `gh pr create`
- Default base branch for all PRs is `dev`
