# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for Claude Code

## Working Mode

The project owner is a non-programmer founder. For all technical decisions (libraries, config, patterns, structure, tooling), decide based on what you see in the codebase and proceed without asking. Only ask about business logic decisions — who can access what, what should happen when X occurs, user-facing behavior, and workflow rules.

## Project Overview

CRM28 — Property/building management CRM for the Georgian market. Domain: crm28.asg.ge
Manages buildings, residents, work orders, incidents, sales leads, inventory, telephony, multi-channel chat.

- **Backend**: NestJS 11 (TypeScript) — `backend/crm-backend/`, port 3000, `npm run start:dev`
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 App Router, React 19 — `frontend/crm-frontend/`, port 4002, `pnpm dev --port 4002`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 (production VM 192.168.65.110, port 5432) / PostgreSQL 16 (local dev Docker `crm-prod-db`, port 5433) via Prisma 7 ORM
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO — namespaces: `/messenger`, `/telephony`, `/ws/clientchats`
- **Telephony**: Asterisk/FreePBX 16 + AMI Bridge (`ami-bridge/`, VM 192.168.65.110, port 3100 health) + Electron softphone (`crm-phone/`)
- **Auth**: JWT in httpOnly cookie (`access_token`), Passport, 24h expiry
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o + Whisper (call quality reviews)
- **Chat Channels**: Viber, Facebook, Telegram, WebChat (WhatsApp planned) — adapter pattern
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS v4 (PostCSS plugin, theme in `globals.css`, NO `tailwind.config` file)
- **Core Sync**: One-way sync from legacy MySQL → CRM via webhook bridge (`core-sync-bridge/`, VM 192.168.65.110, port 3101 health). See `docs/CORE_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Operations Dashboard**: Integrated monitoring at `/admin/monitor/` (password-protected, port 9090 on VM). See `vm-configs/crm-monitor/`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions self-hosted runner on VM → auto-deploy on push to master (`.github/workflows/deploy-vm.yml`). Railway is staging only (`crm28demo.asg.ge`, deploys from `dev` branch).
- **Deployment**: VM auto-deploys on master merge via GitHub Actions. Steps: pull → **stop backend** → install deps (--prefer-offline, shared pnpm store) → prisma generate → migrate → seed-permissions → **seed-system-lists** (PR #267) → build → restart backend + frontend → health check. Backend is stopped before `pnpm install` to release Windows file locks on native modules (bcrypt.node). Railway serves as staging environment.

### Quick Start
```powershell
docker start crm-prod-db                          # Database
cd backend\crm-backend ; npm run start:dev         # Backend on :3000
cd frontend\crm-frontend ; pnpm dev --port 4002    # Frontend on :4002
```

### First-Time Setup
```powershell
cd backend\crm-backend
pnpm install ; pnpm prisma generate ; npx prisma migrate dev ; pnpm seed:all
```
`seed:all` runs all 8 seed scripts in dependency order. `seed-permissions.ts` is the canonical seed (not `seed-rbac.ts`).

---

## Git Rules (ENFORCED)

- **NEVER commit directly to master** — master is production
- Always work on `feature/*` branches created from master
- Branch protection is enforced via PreToolUse hook
- PRs target master directly — NO dev or staging branches exist
- Jemiko merges PRs manually after testing on localhost
- Commit format: `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `refactor(scope):`, `test(scope):`, `docs(scope):`, `chore(scope):`

### Feature Flow
1. `git checkout master ; git pull origin master`
2. `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Build the feature
4. `git push origin feature/my-feature`
5. `gh pr create --base master --title "feat(scope): description"`
6. Tell me: "Ready to test on localhost"
7. I test → merge PR → VM auto-deploys via GitHub Actions

### Stop Conditions — ASK Before Doing
1. Database schema breaking changes (dropping columns, renaming)
2. API contract changes (removing endpoints, incompatible changes)
3. Asterisk/FreePBX config changes (ALWAYS apply via GUI too)
4. Deleting files or large refactors
5. Changing environment variables (both local and VM production may need updates; Railway staging may also need updates)
6. Changing seed scripts (affects VM production deployment)

### ⛔ ABSOLUTE RULE: Core MySQL Database is READ-ONLY
**NEVER, under ANY circumstances, execute INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, CREATE, TRUNCATE, or any data-modifying statement against the core MySQL database (192.168.65.97:3306).** This applies to:
- All Claude agents and subagents working on this project
- The Core Sync Bridge service
- CRM backend code
- VM production deployment
- Any script, migration, or tool

**Read queries MUST use non-locking reads** (`SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED` or explicit `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` avoidance). Never use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or any locking SELECT. The core database serves critical production applications — CRM must never cause slowdowns, locks, or data corruption. Violation of this rule can halt company operations.

---

## Verification Commands

After any backend change:
```powershell
cd backend\crm-backend ; pnpm typecheck       # TypeScript check
cd backend\crm-backend ; pnpm lint             # Lint
cd backend\crm-backend ; pnpm test:unit        # Unit tests
```

After any frontend change:
```powershell
cd frontend\crm-frontend ; pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript check
cd frontend\crm-frontend ; pnpm build          # Production build
```

After any Prisma schema change:
```powershell
cd backend\crm-backend ; npx prisma generate
cd backend\crm-backend ; npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name
```

After any API change, test the endpoint with curl or the existing test suite.

### Pre-Completion Checklist
Before telling me "ready to test":
1. All verification commands pass (typecheck, lint, tests)
2. No `console.log` left (unless intentional logging)
3. No hardcoded URLs, ports, credentials
4. `useListItems()` for all dropdowns — never hardcode dropdown values
5. `apiGet/apiPost/apiPatch/apiDelete` for all HTTP calls — never raw `fetch()`
6. Permissions added if needed (seed-permissions.ts + backend guard + frontend hook)
7. **i18n: All user-facing strings translated** — use `useI18nContext()` + `t()` for every string in frontend components. Add keys to both `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/ka.json`. Never hardcode user-facing text in English or Georgian directly in components.
8. Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, API_ROUTE_MAP.md, FRONTEND_ROUTE_MAP.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)

---

## Critical Rule: Asterisk/FreePBX

When making ANY Asterisk/FreePBX changes via CLI/SSH:
1. Make the change via CLI
2. **ALSO apply the same change through the FreePBX web GUI** (or run `fwconsole reload` at minimum)
3. If you only change via CLI, the next time someone clicks "Apply Config" in the FreePBX GUI, the GUI's version **silently overwrites** CLI changes — they're LOST
4. For queue changes: edit in GUI → Apply Config → verify with `asterisk -rx "queue show"`
5. For manager config: edit `/etc/asterisk/manager_custom.conf` → `asterisk -rx "manager reload"` → verify in GUI
6. Rule of thumb: treat the FreePBX GUI as the source of truth, use CLI only for verification

---

## Silent Override Risks (Always Check)

Flag any situation where a value lives in more than one place. Known risks:

0. **⛔ Core MySQL is READ-ONLY** — The core database at 192.168.65.97:3306 must NEVER be written to. All queries must be non-locking SELECTs. Use `SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED` on every connection. Never use `FOR UPDATE`, `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, or any write statement. This database serves multiple critical production applications.
1. **JWT secret fallback** — `JWT_SECRET` is required, app crashes if missing. Ensure no hardcoded default exists anywhere.
2. **Telephony ingest secret sync** — `TELEPHONY_INGEST_SECRET` must match between VM backend env and AMI Bridge env (both on same VM). Changing one without the other silently breaks telephony ingestion.
2b. **Core webhook secret sync** — `CRM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on the bridge must match `CORE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on VM backend. Changing one without the other silently breaks core sync.
3. **Hardcoded cookie names** — All gateways (telephony + messenger) use `COOKIE_NAME` env var for cookie extraction. Frontend and backend must agree.
4. **Prisma enum migration behavior** — PostgreSQL CANNOT use a new enum value in the same transaction that adds it. If migration fails with "unsafe use of new value", either use fresh DB or apply `ALTER TYPE` manually outside transaction, then `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <name>`. Always check existing data before enum changes.
5. **AMI Bridge buffer risks under load** — AMI event relay runs on same VM as CRM backend under PM2. High call volume can cause event buffering/loss if the bridge falls behind.
6. **Rate limiter vs webhook conflict** — Global ThrottlerGuard (60 req/60s per IP) applies to most routes. Webhooks, health, and telephony ingestion have `@SkipThrottle()`. New webhook endpoints MUST add `@SkipThrottle()` or external services will get 429'd.
7. **Unwired HealthModule** — `/health` endpoint exists with DB + memory checks. Verify it's imported in `app.module.ts` and actually responding.
8. **Dual RBAC systems** — Legacy `RolesModule` exists alongside Position-based RBAC (`RoleGroups → Permissions`). Both are imported in `app.module.ts`. Position RBAC is authoritative. Legacy module is technical debt — do not build new features on it.
9. **Seed script ordering dependencies** — `seed:all` orchestrates 8 scripts in dependency order (permissions first). Running individual seeds out of order can cause foreign key violations. `seed-permissions.ts` is canonical for production; never run `seed-rbac.ts` in production.
10. **Frontend API rewrite localhost default** — `next.config.ts` rewrites `/auth/*`, `/v1/*`, `/public/*` to backend. Falls back to `http://localhost:3000` which is correct on VM (co-located). On Railway staging, `API_BACKEND_URL` must be set explicitly.
11. **Message deduplication race condition** — `clientchats-core.service.ts processInbound()` pipeline order is load-bearing: dedup → upsert → save → match → emit. Changing this order can cause duplicate messages or lost customer name data (`isBetterName()` guard).
12. **JWT claim access — always `payload.sub`, never `payload.id`** (PR #250) — the telephony Socket.IO gateway and all downstream services standardized on `sub`. Old code accessing `payload.id` will silently fail auth. JWT contract integration tests enforce this.
13. **SIP password NOT on disk** (PR #249, v1.9.0 softphone) — `sipPassword` must never be persisted to the Electron `session-store` file. `crm-phone/src/main/session-store.ts::stripPassword()` enforces this; old on-disk sessions are migrated on read. If you add a new field to `AppLoginResponse` that contains sensitive data, follow the same pattern or it will hit disk.
14. **Reduced bridge `/status` payload** (PR #253) — the local softphone bridge on `127.0.0.1:19876/status` returns only `{ id }` (user UUID). Any local process can poll this endpoint; leaking name/email/extension would expose operator identity to untrusted PCs. If extending the bridge, preserve this boundary.
15. **`timestampevents=yes` lives in `/etc/asterisk/manager.conf`, NOT `manager_custom.conf`** (PR #263) — FreePBX 15/16 does not support overriding the `[general]` section via `_custom.conf`. This is an exception to rule #123 above. A FreePBX "Apply Config" click from the web GUI WILL silently wipe it. If AMI event timestamps disappear from stats, check this setting first.
16. **Stats — missing CallMetrics ≠ silent drop** (PR #255) — any change to the stats-ingestion or stats-read path must preserve the `reason: "unknown"` behavior for CallSessions without CallMetrics. Silently dropping them masks ingest bugs. See `audit/STATS_STANDARDS.md` (M3 decision).
17. **Replayed `call_end` events merge, don't overwrite** (PR #255) — telephony ingestion applies field-level merge on duplicate terminal events. Only null/missing fields are overwritten. Changing this to a full-replace can corrupt finalized call records when the AMI bridge buffers/replays events. See `audit/STATS_STANDARDS.md` (M7 decision).
18. **`TelephonyQueue.isAfterHoursQueue` is sticky — env var only bootstraps, DB is authoritative** (PR #280) — `asterisk-sync.service.ts` writes `isAfterHoursQueue` ONLY on CREATE (using the `AFTER_HOURS_QUEUES` env var list). On subsequent UPDATE ticks (every 5 min) it leaves the flag untouched so admin/DB changes persist. Consequence: **changing `AFTER_HOURS_QUEUES` env var has NO effect on queue rows that already exist**. To toggle an existing queue, update the DB directly (or use a future admin UI). `MissedCallReason.OUT_OF_HOURS` classification depends on this flag; silent drift here = OUT_OF_HOURS calls mis-tagged as NO_ANSWER.

## Module Boundaries

### Backend (`backend/crm-backend/src/`)
Each NestJS module owns its domain: controller + service + DTOs + module file. Key modules:

| Module | Domain | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `auth/` | JWT login, /me, logout | Requires JWT_SECRET |
| `prisma/` | PrismaService | Extends PrismaClient + manages pg.Pool. Must call both `$disconnect()` AND `pool.end()` on shutdown |
| `buildings/` | Building CRUD | |
| `clients/` | Client service | Accessed via `v1/` controllers |
| `assets/` | Building devices | Terminology: "Devices" = building assets |
| `incidents/` | Incident management | Known bug: null client constraint violation |
| `work-orders/` | Work order lifecycle | Products, approval flow, inventory deduction ONLY after approval |
| `inventory/` | Products, stock, batches | Terminology: "Products" = inventory items |
| `employees/` | Employee lifecycle | Hard delete requires delegating active leads/work orders first |
| `departments/` | Department hierarchy | |
| `positions/` | Positions | Linked to RoleGroups |
| `role-groups/` | Permission bundles | |
| `permissions/` | RBAC CRUD | |
| `system-lists/` | Dynamic dropdown values | |
| `workflow/` | Workflow steps, triggers | |
| `sales/` | Leads, pipeline | |
| `messenger/` | Internal chat | Socket.IO `/messenger` |
| `telephony/` | Call center | Socket.IO `/telephony`, AMI, ARI, CDR, quality, AgentPresenceService (PR #260), CallLeg backfill (PR #264). Permission-gated: `telephony.call`, `softphone.handshake`, `call_logs.*`, `call_recordings.*`, `missed_calls.*`. See `docs/TELEPHONY_INTEGRATION.md` |
| `clientchats/` | Unified inbox | Socket.IO `/ws/clientchats`. FRAGILE: `processInbound()`, `joinConversation()`, `isBetterName()` |
| `notifications/` | Email + SMS | |
| `translations/` | i18n | |
| `audit/` | Audit log | |
| `health/` | Health endpoint | DB + memory checks |
| `bug-reports/` | Bug reporter (beta) | Claude AI analysis + GitHub issue creation. Env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN |
| `core-integration/` | Core system sync | Webhook receiver + upsert logic. See `docs/CORE_INTEGRATION.md` |
| `common/` | Guards, filters, decorators | |
| `v1/` | Versioned controllers | |

### Prisma (`backend/crm-backend/prisma/`)
- `schema.prisma` — 70+ models, 40+ enums (single file). NEVER edit applied migration files.
- `migrations/` — NEVER edit applied migrations
- `seed-*.ts` — 8 seed scripts + `seed-all.ts` orchestrator

### Frontend (`frontend/crm-frontend/`)
- All authenticated pages are `"use client"` components under `src/app/app/` (47 pages)
- `src/lib/api.ts` — API client. Returns `undefined as T` on 204. Returns never-resolving Promise on 401.
- `src/hooks/useListItems.ts` — Dynamic dropdown hook
- `src/lib/use-permissions.ts` — RBAC hook
- `src/app/app/modal-stack-context.tsx` — VERY FRAGILE. Syncs with browser history via pushState/popstate. URL param priority: messenger → incident → workOrder → employee → client → building.
- `src/app/app/layout.tsx` — FRAGILE. If MessengerContext, ModalStackContext, or I18nContext throws on init, entire app goes blank.
- Modals: `createPortal` + mounted check + z-index (detail: 10000, action: 50000+). Never render inline.
- React hooks: ALL hooks BEFORE any conditional returns (React #310 crash)

**Do not create cross-module dependencies without documenting them.**

---

## For Subagents

When working as a subagent, read this file first. Key rules:
1. Check the **Verification Commands** section — run relevant checks before reporting done
2. Do not modify files outside your assigned module without explicit instruction
3. Use `apiGet/apiPost` (not raw `fetch()`) and `useListItems()` (not hardcoded dropdowns)
4. Never commit to master — work on feature branches only
5. Check **Silent Override Risks** if your change touches config, env vars, or cross-module boundaries

---

## Business Rules

### Work Order Lifecycle
`CREATED → LINKED_TO_GROUP → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/CANCELED`
- Types: INSTALLATION, DIAGNOSTIC, RESEARCH, DEACTIVATE, REPAIR_CHANGE, ACTIVATE
- Approval: technician submits → head reviews products → approves (inventory deducted) → or cancels
- **Inventory deduction happens ONLY after approval — never before**

### Incident Lifecycle
`CREATED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/WORK_ORDER_INITIATED`
- Building required, client optional (null client causes known bug)
- Auto-numbered INC-YYYY-####

### Sales Pipeline
`NEW → CONTACT → MEETING → PROPOSAL → NEGOTIATION → APPROVED → WON/LOST`
- Approval: employee submits → lead locks → approver reviews → WON or rejects → unlocks

### RBAC
- Chain: User → Employee → Position → RoleGroup → Permissions
- ~100 permissions, 12 categories
- Backend: `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PositionPermissionGuard)` + `@RequirePermission()`
- Frontend: `usePermissions()`, `<PermissionButton>`, `<PermissionGuard>`
- Superadmin bypasses all
- **Scope pattern** (`*.own` / `*.department` / `*.department_tree` / `*.all`) via `backend/crm-backend/src/common/utils/data-scope.ts` — canonical for per-user vs per-department vs org-wide visibility. Used by `call_logs.*`, `call_recordings.*`.

**Production RoleGroup codes** (seeded via `seed-permissions.ts`):

| Code | Display name | Typical use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `ADMINISTRATOR` | Administrator | Full access, superadmin-equivalent |
| `CALL_CENTER` | Call Center Operator | Line-level operators (`call_logs.own`, `call_recordings.own`, `telephony.call`, `softphone.handshake`) |
| `CALL_CENTER_MANAGER` | Call Center Manager | Supervisors (own + department + department_tree scope, `call_center.live/quality/reports/statistics`) |
| `IT_TESTING` | IT Testing | Internal QA |
| `READ_ONLY` | Read Only | View-only dashboards |

### Employee Lifecycle
`ACTIVE → TERMINATED (dismiss) → ACTIVE (reactivate) or DELETED (permanent)`
- EMP-### IDs never reused (ExternalIdCounter table)
- Hard delete requires delegating active leads/work orders first

### Client Chats
- Channel adapters: Viber, Facebook, Telegram, WebChat (WhatsApp planned)
- Queue: weekly schedule + daily overrides, operators join manually
- Escalation: auto-escalate on SLA timeout
- Display name chain: CRM Client name → participant.displayName → "Unknown Customer"
- Closed conversation archival rewrites externalConversationId to `${id}__archived_${timestamp}` — changing this breaks conversation threading

---

## Cron Jobs
| Service | Schedule | What it does | Concern |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `escalation.service.ts` | Every 1 min | Check chat SLA rules | Overlap-guarded |
| `cdr-import.service.ts` | Every 5 min | Import CDR from Asterisk | — |
| `asterisk-sync.service.ts` | Every 5 min | Sync extension/queue state | — |
| `quality-pipeline.service.ts` | Every 2 min | OpenAI call reviews | Overlap-guarded |

### Core Sync Bridge Schedules (PM2, separate process)
| Task | Schedule | What it does | Concern |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Delta poll (timestamp + ID sweep) | Every 5 min | Sync changed/new buildings, clients, assets from core MySQL | Overlap-guarded (10 min timeout) |
| Count check | Every 60 min | Compare entity counts core vs CRM, log mismatches | Requires bridge-health endpoint (shared secret) |
| Gap repair | 3 AM daily | Fix mismatches via ID-set diff | Only runs if countMismatches non-empty |
| Gates/contacts reload | 4 AM daily | Full reload of tables without timestamps | — |
| Failed event retry | Every 30 min | Re-process FAILED SyncEvents (max 3 retries) | — |

---

## Environment & Access

### Environment Variables
**Backend (.env):** DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRES_IN, PORT, CORS_ORIGINS, COOKIE_NAME, COOKIE_SECURE, VIBER_BOT_TOKEN, FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN, FB_APP_SECRET, FB_VERIFY_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, WA_ACCESS_TOKEN, WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID, WA_VERIFY_TOKEN, WA_APP_SECRET, CLIENTCHATS_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL, TELEPHONY_INGEST_SECRET, AMI_ENABLED, AMI_HOST, AMI_PORT, AMI_USER, AMI_SECRET, ARI_ENABLED, ARI_BASE_URL, ARI_USER, ARI_PASSWORD, OPENAI_API_KEY, QUALITY_AI_ENABLED, QUALITY_AI_MODEL, ASTERISK_SIP_SERVER (default: 5.10.34.153)

**Frontend (.env.local):** NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE (default http://localhost:3000), API_BACKEND_URL

**AMI Bridge (.env on VM):** AMI_HOST, AMI_PORT, AMI_USER, AMI_SECRET, CRM_BASE_URL, TELEPHONY_INGEST_SECRET, BUFFER_MAX_SIZE, BUFFER_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS, HEALTH_PORT, LOG_LEVEL

**Core Sync Bridge (.env on VM):** CORE_MYSQL_HOST, CORE_MYSQL_PORT, CORE_MYSQL_USER, CORE_MYSQL_PASSWORD, CORE_MYSQL_DATABASE, CRM_WEBHOOK_URL, CRM_WEBHOOK_SECRET, POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES, COUNT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES, NIGHTLY_REPAIR_HOUR, LOG_LEVEL

### Remote Access
| Server | Access | VPN Required |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Production VM (192.168.65.110) | `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_vm Administrator@192.168.65.110` | Yes |
| Asterisk/FreePBX | `ssh asterisk` | Yes |
| Core MySQL (READ-ONLY) | 192.168.65.97:3306, user `asg_tablau`, db `tttt` | Yes (via VM only) |
| Railway (staging) | `railway logs`, `railway status` (link to dev environment) | No |
| Production DB | `psql -U postgres -h 192.168.65.110` (from VM) or via Prisma Studio | Yes |
| Staging DB | `railway variables -s Postgres` for public URL (dev environment) | No |

OpenVPN is always-on (TAP adapter). If Asterisk SSH times out, check OpenVPN GUI.

`psql` is NOT installed locally. Use `npx prisma studio` or `docker exec -it crm-prod-db psql -U postgres` (local dev). For production: SSH to VM, then `C:\postgresql17\pgsql\bin\psql.exe -U postgres -d crm`.

### VM Infrastructure (192.168.65.110) — PRODUCTION
Windows Server 2022, public IP 5.10.36.43, domain crm28.asg.ge. Full CRM stack under PM2 + Windows services:

| Service | Path on VM | Port | Description |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| PostgreSQL 17 | `C:\postgresql17\` | 5432 | Production database (Windows service) |
| Nginx 1.27 | `C:\nginx\` | 80/443 | HTTPS reverse proxy (Windows service) |
| CRM Backend | `C:\crm\backend\crm-backend\` | 3000 | NestJS API (PM2) |
| CRM Frontend | `C:\crm\frontend\crm-frontend\` | 4002 | Next.js app (PM2) |
| AMI Bridge | `C:\ami-bridge\` | 3100 (health) | Asterisk AMI → CRM events (PM2) |
| Core Sync Bridge | `C:\core-sync-bridge\` | 3101 (health) | Core MySQL → CRM sync (PM2) |
| Operations Dashboard | `C:\crm\crm-monitor\` | 9090 | Monitoring UI at `/admin/monitor/` (PM2) |
| GitHub Actions Runner | `C:\actions-runner\` | — | Self-hosted runner for auto-deploy |

- **Auto-deploy**: Push to master → GitHub Actions → pulls, builds, migrates, restarts PM2
- **Dashboard**: `https://crm28.asg.ge/admin/monitor/` (password-protected)
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt via win-acme, auto-renews
- **SSH tunnel**: AMI bridge reaches Asterisk (5.10.34.153:5038) via SSH tunnel on VM — port 5038 blocked at network level
- **Auto-start**: Windows Scheduled Task "PM2 Startup - CRM28" runs `pm2-startup.ps1` on boot (starts PostgreSQL → Nginx → PM2 resurrect)
- **Health check**: Scheduled task runs `health-check.ps1` every 2 minutes with auto-recovery
- **Docs**: `docs/AMI_BRIDGE.md`, `docs/CORE_INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/VM_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

## Automation Rules

### Plan Before Code
Before writing code for medium/complex tasks: state files, explain approach, flag risks, wait for "go". Simple tasks (typo, label, spacing): just do it.

### Auto-Test
After any feature or fix: write unit tests (.spec.ts next to source) — happy path + error + edge case. Mock PrismaService and external services. Run tests, report count.

### Auto-Update Docs
After any feature, update in the same commit: CLAUDE.md, API_ROUTE_MAP.md, FRONTEND_ROUTE_MAP.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (as applicable).

### Permission-Aware
When building access-controlled features: add to seed-permissions.ts → backend `@RequirePermission()` → frontend `usePermissions()` → sidebar `*.menu` permission.

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt
- Incident without client: null constraint violation
- Dashboard: static placeholder (no API)
- WhatsApp adapter: schema ready, adapter not built
- Work order export: permissions exist, no UI
- Web chat widget: backend ready, no embeddable JS widget
- Some pages use raw `fetch()` instead of `apiGet/apiPost`
- Legacy RolesModule alongside Position RBAC (both imported — Position RBAC is authoritative)
- Single 2125-line Prisma schema
- `rawBody: true` enabled globally (only needed for webhook HMAC)
- Both `bcrypt` AND `bcryptjs` installed — check which is imported before changing auth
- Core sync bridge count-verification uses `bridge-health` endpoint (shared-secret auth, no JWT). If backend restarts during deploy, count check returns 401 transiently — gap repair skips that cycle but resumes on next success
- `smartgsmgate` and `contactperson` tables have no timestamps — can't be delta-polled, only bulk-loaded (daily 4 AM reload)
- ~51% of core MySQL clients have `NULL lastModifiedDate` — invisible to timestamp-based delta polling. Fixed by ID-based sweep (`WHERE id > maxCheckpoint`) that runs alongside timestamp polling every 5 minutes
- Railway → VM migration complete (April 2026). Railway is staging only at crm28demo.asg.ge
